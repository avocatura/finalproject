# JSR Finalproject

## This site uses the Edamam API to search for and filter through recipes.

##On loading of the page, the user can search for a type of recipe or ingredients in the recipe using the search bar. Once submitted, the API will be called and the results will load on the page.

##Each recipe will display a title, a picture and a link to the recipe.

##The user can refine the search by clicking on the refine button which opens a dropdown menu with different health options that may be checked. Once the user checks boxes and clicks search, the API will be called again using those new restraints.
